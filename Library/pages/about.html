			<h1>Introduction</h1>

				<div class="textwrapper1">
					<p>Our e-library is our way of showing our love and passion for marine life, especially sharks.
					Many have perceived sharks as dangerous creatures, but this perception simply isn't true. Sharks
					in reality are relatively peaceful animals. According to the Florida Museum of Natural History,
					<a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/yearly-worldwide-summary/"> In 2024 there were 
					only 47 confirmed unprovoked cases worldwide</a>, which is in line with the most recent five-year (2019-2023) 
					average of 64 incidents annually. Which is why we hold both the books that perpetuated this stereotype and 
					the many books that aim to dispel it.</p>
					
					<p>This website was created as a group project for a programming course: OPEN SOURCE PRACTICE. 
					We created this website as a fun way to practice HTML, CSS, and simple JS. We consider this 
					to be a parody website that isn't supposed to be taken seriously.</p>

			<h1>History</h1>
			
			<p>This e-library was created in the span of two weeks from April 8th to the 22nd. As there were midterms the 
			week after the project was announced, we were only able to make the basic structure of our project as well as 
			outline the page layouts before the last few days of the project.</p>

			<section>
				<img src="../images/home_page_sketch.png" alt="a poorly drawn layout for a website home page" class="history-image">
				<div class="textwrapper2">
					<p>The rough sketch of the homepage was created after the group settled on the design for clarity. 
					吳得豐 had already created a barebones html page for the website and was looking for clarity on the final design.
					So he opened MS Paint and sketched this layout in about thirty seconds. His teammates seeing this quickly
					settled on this design as they had to still prepare for their midterm exams.</p>

					<p>This logo was originally conceptualized by 林大偉 and was later redrawn by 吳得豐.</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			
			<p>The rest of the projects history and development was unfortunately not archived as we were in a hurry to finish 
			this project within the allotted time.</p>
